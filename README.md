# Eat-Sleep-Travel-Repeat

Based on the passion and demand to travel and enjoy delicious food post pandemic, our team has decided to implement a Web Application that recommends restaurants/places for users based on their favorites, geolocation, personal habit and word-of-mouth rating. The project is to design a web application based on two dataset: Yelp restaurant dataset and Airlines within the United states. We intend to deliver a convenient way for users to choose and plan where to go and what to eat. 

This is a class project for CIS 550.
